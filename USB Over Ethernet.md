<h1>What is a USB Redirector Server?</h1>


USB Network Gate is a professional USB redirector application developed by Eltima Software. You can use this communication solution to share multiple USB ports and devices with remote users over a network. Using an IP-based network such as your LAN, VPN, WAN or the Internet, remote client computers can gain access to shared USB devices. Connecting through the USB Redirector Server enables the remote computers to use the USB peripherals with the full functionality of a local connection.
 
Internally, USB Network Gate is comprised of a server and client component which are combined in a single application. Only the server requires registration. Clients don’t need to be registered and they can continue to be used to access devices after the trial period ends. The server that shares the devices does need to be registered.
 
This USB Redirector software can be run on the Windows, Linux or macOS operating systems. It offers a true cross-platform solution supporting any combination of servers and clients. Share devices attached to any type of server with all supported clients without compatibility issues.
 
Let’s investigate a server implementation of USB Redirector running on a Windows machine.
 
<h2>USB Redirector Server for Windows</h2>
  
The first step in sharing a USB device remotely is to connect it directly to a port on the USB Redirector Server. You will obtain the best results by using a port that is already connected to a device you wish to share.

You can share the port before plugging in a device. The only requirement is that you know which is the available port. 
 

<h3>Customizing USB Redirector Server’s settings</h3>
 
Various settings can be customized to provide a configuration that fits your requirements. Some of the connection settings that can be modified include encryption, compression, and TCP port. You can also password protect a port or device to limit access to authorized users.

Tip: Sharing problems may be resolved by physically disconnecting the device from its port. Share the interface through the application and plug the device back into the port. 
 
You should now be able to access the shared USB device from the client side.
 
 
USB Redirector Server is sharing your USB ports rather than the devices. This enables you to freely disconnect one device and connect a different one. The newly attached device immediately appears and is available for client use with no configuration necessary.
 
 

<h2>USB Redirector Server for Linux</h2>
 
The first step in sharing a USB device remotely is to connect it to a shared interface on the USB redirector server. Best results are achieved by sharing a port after plugging in the device you want to access remotely. If you are certain that you know which port is free, you can share it before attaching a peripheral device.
  
Open the window The Share USB device. In this window, you can obtain supplemental information concerning the USB devices such as its serial number and manufacturer.
Set the TCP port that you want to be employed with the connection.
    
Tip: If you have problems sharing the device you may be successful by unplugging from the port. Share the port first and then reattach the device. You should be able to share it at this point.
 
Now you can access the shared USB device from the client side.
  
 
 
<h2>USB Redirector Server for Mac</h2>
 
To shared devices on a macOS computer, perform the following steps.
 
Launch USB Network Gate. Click Local pane from the top of the window.
 
The Local pane displays a list of the currently connected USB devices. Select the device you wish to share and if it not visible, reconnect it and try again.
You need configure sharing options for the USB device. And next you click Share after making the configuration changes. The USB device is now shared and is available for connection by client computers.
